# TravelBuddy React Application
This is the react-native application used to build this.

## Requirements
You must have the most up-to-date Mac OS, and must have the most up-to-date XCode installed on your computer to run. Otherwise it will fail. Additionally, you need to have the iPhone X simulator installed within XCode. (There is a weird build error I was not able to solve when running locally, but it exports to all real devices fine.)

## How To Run

1. Run the following command to build the iOS application.

```bash
react-native run-ios
```
